## Dr. House (Team #232 BHS)

Dr. House is an intelligent healthcare application that leverages artificial intelligence to monitor drug safety and detect potentially dangerous medication interactions in real-time. The system analyzes patient-reported side effects to identify unusual spikes in adverse reactions, comparing current data against historical baselines to flag concerning patterns before they become widespread health crises. Using advanced LLM technology (Groq/OpenAI), the platform can detect previously unknown drug interactions by analyzing medication descriptions and clinical effects, providing healthcare providers with AI-generated insights and confidence scores for each potential risk. The application features role-based access for both doctors and patients, comprehensive analytics dashboards, and automated alert systems that notify medical professionals of critical safety issues requiring immediate attention. Built with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) and designed for scalability, Dr. House represents a proactive approach to pharmaceutical safety that could prevent thousands of adverse drug events and save lives through early detection and intervention.
